# R as a server

## R as a server

How can btw talk to my favorite coding agent?

```{r}
#| label: r-as-a-server-simplified
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "A system architecture diagram showing three main components: Client (left), Server (center), and Session (right). The Client box lists AI coding assistants including Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Copilot Chat in VS Code, and Positron Assistant. The Server is initiated with `mcp_server()` and contains tools for R functions like reading package documentation, running R code, and inspecting global environment objects. Sessions can be configured with `mcp_session()` and can optionally connect to interactive R sessions, with two example projects shown: 'Some R Project' and 'Other R Project'."
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_as_a_server_simplified.png")
```

<!-- Demo: In Claude Desktop, ask about ellmer::tool -->

## R as a server: workflow

For a given project:

* Mention relevant help-files in `AGENTS.md`
* Ask the agent to read them on startup

<!-- Demo: In Claude Code, do the \read-up -->

# R as a client

## R as a client

Folks building apps with ellmer/shinychat can hook up to third-party servers:

```{r}
#| label: r-as-a-client
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: "An architecture diagram showing the Client (left) with R code using the ellmer library to create a chat object and then setting tools from mcp with `mcp_tools()`, and the Server (right) containing third-party tools including GitHub (for reading PRs/Issues), Confluence (for searching), and Google Drive (for searching). Bidirectional arrows indicate communication between the client and server components."
knitr::include_graphics("figures/r_as_a_client.png")
```

## R as a client

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(ellmer)
library(mcptools)

client <- chat_anthropic()

# Currently have GitHub MCP configured
client$register_tools(mcp_tools())
```

```{r}
#| eval: false

Imagine:

* MCP Server A: reading emails
* MCP Server B: sending emails

. . .

A bad actor could email you, saying:
