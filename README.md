Source code and slides for "R and the Model Context Protocol." This is a talk about mcptools, a package written in collaboration with Winston Chang and Charlie Gao.

Some resources:

* [mcptools package website](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/): Documentation and such.
* The best entry point to mcptools is probably btw, which provides a [`btw_mcp_server()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/btw/reference/mcp.html) with all of btw's tools as a default.
* This talk is based off of [this blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2025/07/mcptools-0-1-0/) on the tidyverse blog. 
* I mention the [lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/) in this talk; vulnerability to the lethal trifecta _was_ possible before MCP, but MCP makes it very easy to accidentally fall into this situation.
* I also called out the [first public release](https://posit.co/blog/2025-08-29-ai-newsletter/) of the Posit AI Newsletter! If you dig it, please share!
