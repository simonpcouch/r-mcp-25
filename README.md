Source code and slides for "R and the Model Context Protocol." This is a talk about mcptools, a package written in collaboration with Winston Chang and Charlie Gao.

Some resources:

* [mcptools package website](https://posit-dev.github.io/mcptools/): Documentation and such.
* The best entry point to mcptools is probably btw, which provides a [`btw_mcp_server()`](https://posit-dev.github.io/btw/reference/mcp.html) with all of btw's tools as a default.
* This talk is based off of [this blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2025/07/mcptools-0-1-0/) on the tidyverse blog.
